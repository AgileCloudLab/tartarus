# NEWS 

## 4.0.0

We have moved all reader functions into the same file called `reader.hpp` and create a `writer.hpp` file as well. 

We have removed the `reader/json_reader.hpp` file as well

## 2.0.0

* We have added file meta data to the `raw_data` and `coded_data` structures. So file name, file size, and MIME type can be registered. 
* We have renamed `pivot` to `base` in `coded_pairs`
